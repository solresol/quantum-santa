  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC-12:00 is used by Baker Island, which is an uninhabited atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The latitudes between 80N and 90N correspond to the Arctic region, specifically the northernmost parts of the Arctic Ocean, Greenland, and some surrounding islands. However, within this specific timezone (UTC-12:00) and latitude range, there are no permanently inhabited cities or households due to the extreme remoteness and inhospitable climate.",
