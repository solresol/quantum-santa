{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC+01:00 is primarily located in Western and Central Europe, Western Africa, and some parts of Antarctica. However, the latitudes between 90S and 80S are entirely within Antarctica, where there are no permanent residents or households. The only inhabitants of this region are temporary scientists and researchers at various stations, who do not constitute traditional households. Therefore, Santa would not have to visit any households in this timezone within the specified latitudes.",
