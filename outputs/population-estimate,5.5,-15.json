    "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+05:30 corresponds to India's standard time. However, the given latitude range 'between 20S and 10S' falls in the Southern Hemisphere, primarily over the Indian Ocean. Since India is located in the Northern Hemisphere, there are no Indian territories or major cities within this specific latitude range. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that Santa would not have any households to visit in this timezone within the specified latitudes.",
