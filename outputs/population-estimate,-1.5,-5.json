    "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-01:30' does not exist. Timezones are typically offset from UTC by whole or half hours, and there is no official timezone with an offset of -01:30. Furthermore, the latitudes between 10S and 0S correspond to a region in the southern hemisphere, primarily covering parts of the Atlantic Ocean and possibly some islands or coastal areas in South America or Africa, but these regions do not use this non-existent timezone.",
