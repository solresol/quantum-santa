    "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-04:00' includes parts of the Atlantic Ocean and some areas in the Western Hemisphere, specifically in the eastern parts of Canada and the United States, as well as some Caribbean islands. However, the latitudes between 30N and 40N within this timezone primarily cover oceanic regions and a few islands. Given that Santa's visits are typically associated with land-based human populations, especially during Christmas when households are most likely to be inhabited, we must consider the presence of significant landmasses and populated areas. Since the specified region largely consists of water and sparse island populations, if any, the number of households for Santa to visit would indeed be minimal to none.",
