{"reasoning": "The latitudes between 90S and 80S correspond to the Antarctic region. This area is largely uninhabited, with no permanent residents, only temporary scientists and researchers at various stations. The timezone UTC-03:00 does cover parts of the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica but does not include any landmass with permanent households in these latitudes. Therefore, there are no households for Santa to visit.",
