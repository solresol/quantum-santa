  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+12:00 includes several Pacific island nations, but the latitudes between 10N and 20N fall within the equatorial region of the Pacific Ocean. The majority of landmasses in this timezone and latitude range are small islands or atolls with limited population. Considering the sparse population and lack of major land areas, it's likely that Santa would not have many households to visit in this specific region.",
