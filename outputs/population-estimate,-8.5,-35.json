{"reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-08:30' is not a valid or recognized timezone. Timezones are typically offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by whole or half hours, but 'UTC-08:30' does not fit into the standard timezone offsets used globally. Furthermore, latitudes between 40S and 30S would include parts of the southern hemisphere, such as areas in South America, Australia, or the southern Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Without a valid timezone to reference specific regions, it's challenging to estimate household numbers directly.",
