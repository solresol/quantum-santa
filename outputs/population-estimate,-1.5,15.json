    "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-01:30' does not exist. Timezones are usually offset from UTC by whole or half hours, and the range is typically between UTC-12 and UTC+12. Additionally, there are no landmasses at latitudes between 10N and 20N that would be in a timezone with an offset close to this value. The closest offset to this is UTC-01:00 or UTC-02:00 for some Atlantic islands but not exactly -01:30.",
