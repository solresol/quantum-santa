  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC-07:00 corresponds to the Mountain Time Zone in North America. The latitudes between 30N and 40N cover parts of the western United States. Major cities in this region include Phoenix, Arizona; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Denver, Colorado. Given the presence of these cities and the cultural influence of Christmas traditions in the United States, it's reasonable to assume that a significant proportion of households might celebrate Christmas and believe in Santa Claus. However, estimating the exact number of households where someone believes in Santa is challenging without specific data on religious and cultural practices. For the sake of estimation, let's consider that a substantial portion of the population in these areas observes Christmas and might have children who believe in Santa.",
