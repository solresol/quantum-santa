  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+06:30 corresponds to the Cocos Islands, which are an Australian external territory in the Indian Ocean. However, considering the latitudes between 70N and 80N, we find ourselves in the Arctic region. There are no permanent cities or households within this specific latitude range that observe a Santa tradition due to the harsh climate and lack of permanent residents. The area is primarily composed of ice sheets, research stations, and occasional camps for scientific expeditions.",
