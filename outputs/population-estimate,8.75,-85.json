{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC+08:45 is not a standard timezone and is actually used by only a few areas in Western Australia, specifically the border region between Western Australia and South Australia, known as the Eucla region. However, this region does not extend to latitudes between 90S and 80S, which would be in Antarctica. There are no permanent households or cities in Antarctica, only research stations. Therefore, Santa would not have any households to visit in this timezone and latitude range.",
