  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+13:00 is used by several Pacific island nations, including Kiribati. The latitudes between 20S and 10S fall within the region of the Pacific Ocean where some of these islands are located. However, given the sparse population and limited land area in this region, it's possible that there are few to no households for Santa to visit. After researching, I found that Kiribati does have some islands within this latitude range, but they are mostly uninhabited or have very small populations.",
