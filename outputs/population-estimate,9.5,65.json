    "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+09:30 is used in Australia, specifically in the state of South Australia and the Northern Territory. However, the latitudes between 60N and 70N are located in the Arctic region, which does not overlap with Australia. This region includes parts of Canada, Alaska (USA), Greenland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. Since the timezone UTC+09:30 is not used in this region, there would be no households for Santa to visit that match both criteria.",
