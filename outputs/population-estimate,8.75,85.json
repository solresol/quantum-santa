{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC+08:45 is not a standard timezone and does not correspond to any specific region. However, assuming it refers to a hypothetical region with this offset, the latitudes between 80N and 90N are located in the Arctic Circle, which is largely uninhabited due to its harsh climate. The few inhabitants of this region are mostly researchers, scientists, and support staff at various research stations.",
