  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC-05:00 and latitudes between 60N and 70N primarily cover areas in the northern parts of Canada, including parts of Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, and Nunavut, as well as a small portion of the northeastern United States. However, given the vast and remote nature of much of this territory, especially at these high latitudes, population density is very low. The majority of the land within these parameters is wilderness or very sparsely populated, with few permanent residents. Santa's visits are typically associated with inhabited areas where children reside, implying that his primary focus would be on more densely populated regions.",
