  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC-05:00 and the latitudes between 80N and 90N correspond to a region in the Arctic, primarily covering parts of Northern Canada, Alaska (USA), and Greenland. This area is largely uninhabited due to its extreme climate, with very few permanent residents. Most of the land within these latitudes is covered by ice or tundra, making it inhospitable for human habitation.",
