{"reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-07:00' corresponds to the Mountain Time Zone in North America. The latitudes between 50N and 60N in this timezone cover parts of Canada and the United States. In these countries, there is a significant tradition of believing in Santa Claus, especially among households with children. Major cities in this region include Calgary, Edmonton, and Grande Prairie in Alberta, Canada, as well as cities like Boise, Idaho, and Butte, Montana, in the United States. Assuming that approximately 30% of households in these regions have at least one child under the age of 15 who might believe in Santa (a conservative estimate considering cultural influences and family traditions), we can estimate the number of households Santa would need to visit.",
