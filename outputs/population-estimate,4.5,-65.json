However, the latitudes between 70S and 60S are in the Southern Ocean, far from any landmass where households or major cities would exist, including those in the UTC+04:30 timezone. This region is entirely within the Antarctic Circle and does not contain any permanent residents or households, only temporary scientists and researchers at various stations.",
