  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC-07:00 corresponds to the Mountain Time Zone in North America. The latitudes between 40N and 50N in this timezone include parts of the western United States and southwestern Canada. There are several major cities in this region, including Boise, Idaho; Helena, Montana; and Calgary, Alberta. Assuming that Santa's visits are focused on households with children who believe in him, we can estimate the number of households based on the population of these cities and surrounding areas. Given the prevalence of Christmas traditions in these countries, it is reasonable to assume that a significant proportion of households have someone who believes in Santa.",
