{"reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-09:00' corresponds to the Alaska Time Zone. The latitudes between 60N and 70N in this timezone would cover parts of Alaska. However, the population density in these areas is very low due to harsh climate conditions. Major cities like Fairbanks and Utqiagvik (formerly known as Barrow) are located within or near these latitudes, but they are relatively small and sparse. Given the remote and inhospitable nature of much of this region, the number of households could be estimated based on the population density and distribution in these areas.",
