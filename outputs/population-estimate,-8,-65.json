  "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-08:00' is observed in the Pacific Time Zone, which includes the western coast of North America. However, the latitudes 'between 70S and 60S' are located in Antarctica, which does not observe this timezone. In fact, Antarctica has no permanent residents, only temporary scientists and researchers at various stations. Therefore, there are no households for Santa to visit in this region.",
