{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC+13:00 is observed by several Pacific island nations, including Kiribati, Tuvalu, and Tokelau. However, the latitudes between 10N and 20N fall within the tropics and are primarily oceanic areas with few landmasses. Upon examination, it appears that none of the major islands or atolls in this timezone and latitude range have significant populations or permanent households. The region is mostly composed of uninhabited coral reefs, atolls, and small islets.",
