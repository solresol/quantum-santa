    "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+08:45 is not a standard timezone and is only observed in a few places, including some parts of Western Australia. The latitudes between 30S and 20S correspond to a region in the southern hemisphere, which includes parts of Australia, South Africa, and South America. However, upon closer examination, it appears that there are no major cities or populated areas within this specific timezone and latitude range. The Eucla, Western Australia region observes UTC+08:45, but it is a small and sparsely populated area.",
