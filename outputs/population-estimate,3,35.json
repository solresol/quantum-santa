{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC+03:00 includes parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia. The latitudes between 30N and 40N cover a significant portion of the Middle East, North Africa, and southern Europe. However, Christmas is not widely celebrated in many countries within this region, as they have predominantly Muslim or other non-Christian populations. Therefore, it's likely that Santa would not visit many households in this area, if any.",
