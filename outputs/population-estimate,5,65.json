{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC+05:00 includes parts of Russia, Pakistan, and India. However, the latitudes between 60N and 70N are primarily located in the Arctic Circle, which is largely uninhabited. In this region, there are no major cities or permanent settlements, only a few research stations and indigenous communities. Therefore, it is unlikely that Santa would have to visit any households in this area.",
