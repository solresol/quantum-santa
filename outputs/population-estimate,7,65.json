  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+07:00 includes parts of Russia, Mongolia, and Indonesia. However, the latitudes between 60N and 70N are located in the Arctic region, which is largely uninhabited. The only landmasses in this range are parts of Russia, Alaska (USA), Canada, Greenland (Denmark), and some islands in the Arctic Ocean. Since UTC+07:00 does not cover any of these regions except for a small part of Russia, we need to focus on the Russian territory within this timezone and latitude range.",
