  "reasoning": "The latitude range 'between 90S and 80S' corresponds to Antarctica, which is largely uninhabited by humans. While there are some research stations on the continent, they do not have permanent households in the classical sense. The timezone 'UTC+02:00' does cover parts of Africa, Europe, and Asia, but it does not apply to Antarctica as the continent does not use traditional time zones due to its unique geographical location and lack of permanent residents.",
