  "reasoning": "The latitude range 'between 70N and 80N' falls within the Arctic Circle, which is largely uninhabited due to its harsh climate. The timezone 'UTC-08:00' corresponds to the Pacific Time Zone in North America, but at these high latitudes, there are no permanent human settlements or cities. This region includes parts of northern Alaska and northern Canada, where the only inhabitants might be temporary research stations or indigenous communities living in very remote areas.",
