{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC-01:00 is observed by some islands in the Atlantic Ocean, including Cape Verde. The latitudes between 10N and 20N fall within the tropics and cover parts of this region. However, since Santa's visits are typically associated with Christmas celebrations and household traditions, we need to consider if there are any inhabited areas within these coordinates that observe Christmas. Given that Cape Verde is a country with a significant Christian population, it is likely that some form of Christmas celebration occurs there. Nevertheless, the number of households might be limited due to the geographical constraints.",
