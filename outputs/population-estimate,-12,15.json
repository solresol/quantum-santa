    "reasoning": "The timezone UTC-12:00 is also known as Baker Island Time. It is used by Baker Island, which is an uninhabited atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The latitudes between 10N and 20N include parts of the ocean but no major landmasses or inhabited islands within this specific timezone. Given that there are no permanent residents on Baker Island, Santa would not have any households to visit in this timezone within the specified latitudes.",
