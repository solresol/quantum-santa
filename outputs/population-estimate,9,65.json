  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+09:00 includes parts of Russia, Japan, and South Korea. However, the latitudes between 60N and 70N are located in the Arctic region, which is largely uninhabited. In Russia, this region includes parts of the Sakha Republic and the Chukchi Autonomous Okrug, but it is very sparsely populated. In Japan, there are no permanent residents at these latitudes, only some research stations. Therefore, it is likely that Santa would not have to visit many households in this region.",
