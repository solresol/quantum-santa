  "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-01:00' is observed by some areas in the North Atlantic, including parts of Greenland. The latitudes between 70N and 80N are within the Arctic Circle and cover a significant portion of the northernmost parts of Greenland, as well as some uninhabited islands. Given the extreme climate conditions and remote location, human habitation is scarce to non-existent in these areas.",
