    "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+11:00 includes areas such as the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and parts of Russia. However, when narrowing it down to latitudes between 20N and 30N, we find that this range primarily covers oceanic areas in the Pacific and does not include significant landmasses where major cities or a large number of households would be located. The few islands within this range are sparsely populated.",
