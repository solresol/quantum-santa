{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC+08:00 and the latitudes between 70N and 80N do not overlap with any densely populated areas. This region is primarily composed of Arctic tundra, ice caps, and remote wilderness. The majority of the landmass within these coordinates belongs to Russia, Canada, Alaska (USA), and Greenland (Denmark). Given the harsh climate and lack of infrastructure in this area, there are very few permanent residents or households.",
