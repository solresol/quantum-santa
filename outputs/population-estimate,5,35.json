{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC+05:00 spans across several countries, including Pakistan, India, and parts of Russia. However, the latitudes between 30N and 40N in this timezone are mostly located in areas with low population density or uninhabitable regions. In Pakistan, this range covers parts of the Balochistan province, which is largely desert. In India, it covers parts of the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan, but again, these areas are not densely populated. There are no major cities in this region that would require a significant number of household visits from Santa.",
