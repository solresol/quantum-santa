  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+13:00 is primarily located in the Pacific Ocean, covering areas such as Kiribati, Tuvalu, and parts of New Zealand's outlying islands. However, when narrowing down to latitudes between 20N and 30N, we find that this range does not intersect with significant landmasses within the UTC+13:00 timezone that are known for human habitation in substantial numbers. Kiribati, for instance, spans from about 1°N to 2°S latitude, which is outside our specified range.",
