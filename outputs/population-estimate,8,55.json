However, the latitudes between 50N and 60N are located in the northernmost parts of these countries, which are generally sparsely populated or uninhabited due to harsh climate conditions. For example, in China, this region includes parts of the provinces of Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia, where the population density is relatively low.",
