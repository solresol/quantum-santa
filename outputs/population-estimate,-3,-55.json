  "reasoning": "The latitude range 'between 60S and 50S' falls within the Southern Ocean, which is largely uninhabited. The few research stations in this region do not constitute a significant number of households. Additionally, the timezone 'UTC-03:00' is used by countries in the Western Hemisphere, but at these latitudes, there are no landmasses that would support permanent human settlements.",
