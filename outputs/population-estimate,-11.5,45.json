  "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-11:30' is not a valid timezone. Timezones are typically represented as UTC+/- an integer number of hours, with some timezones having an additional offset of 30 or 45 minutes. However, there isn't a commonly recognized timezone with the exact offset of -11:30. Additionally, when considering latitudes between 40N and 50N, this range covers parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. Without a valid timezone to reference, it's challenging to precisely determine the geographical area Santa would visit.",
