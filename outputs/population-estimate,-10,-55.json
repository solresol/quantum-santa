    "reasoning": "The timezone UTC-10:00 is observed by the Hawaiian Islands in the Northern Hemisphere, but there are also some uninhabited islands in the Southern Ocean that might observe this timezone. However, these islands are generally not populated by humans. The latitudes between 60S and 50S are located in the Southern Ocean, which surrounds Antarctica. This region is inhospitable to human habitation due to its extreme climate. There are no permanent residents or households in this area, only temporary scientists and researchers at various research stations.",
