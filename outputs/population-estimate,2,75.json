  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+02:00 and the latitudes between 70N and 80N correspond to a region in the Arctic Circle, which is largely uninhabited. The majority of this region consists of ice caps, glaciers, and frozen tundra, making it inhospitable for human habitation. While there may be some research stations or temporary settlements, these are not typically considered households.",
