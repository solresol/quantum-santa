  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+12:00 and the latitudes between 40N and 50N correspond to a region in the Pacific Ocean, specifically the area around Kiribati, Tuvalu, and some other small island nations. This region does not have any major landmasses or large populations. The majority of the population in this timezone lives near the equator, not between 40N and 50N. Therefore, it is likely that there are no households for Santa to visit in this specific region.",
