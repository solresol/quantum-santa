  "reasoning": "The latitude range 'between 90S and 80S' corresponds to the Antarctic region. The timezone 'UTC+04:00' is not applicable in this range as Antarctica does not observe standard time zones like other continents. Most research stations on Antarctica do not have permanent residents, only temporary scientists and researchers. Therefore, there are no households for Santa to visit.",
