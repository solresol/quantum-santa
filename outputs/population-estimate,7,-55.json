  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+07:00 spans across parts of Australia, Antarctica, and the Indian Ocean. However, the latitudes between 60S and 50S are primarily located in Antarctica, where there are no permanent cities or households in the classical sense. The few research stations on the continent do not have traditional households with children who believe in Santa. Therefore, it is unlikely that Santa would need to visit any households in this timezone and latitude range.",
