    "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+08:45 is not a standard timezone and is not officially recognized. However, it is close to the timezone used in Western Australia, which is UTC+8. The latitudes between 10N and 20N cover a region in the northern hemisphere, including parts of Asia and Africa. But considering the specific timezone, we're likely looking at a very small or non-existent area because timezones are typically set by countries or large regions for their entire territory, not narrow strips across different latitudes.",
