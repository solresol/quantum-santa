  "reasoning": "The latitude range 'between 80S and 70S' corresponds to a region in Antarctica, which is largely uninhabited by humans. The few people who do live in this region are mostly scientists and researchers at various stations, and they do not reside in traditional households. Additionally, the timezone 'UTC+02:00' does not apply to Antarctica as the continent does not observe traditional time zones. Therefore, it is unlikely that Santa would have any households to visit in this region.",
