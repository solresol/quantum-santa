{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC+00:00 includes parts of the Atlantic Ocean and western edges of Europe and Africa. The latitudes between 60N and 70N are primarily within the Arctic Circle, encompassing areas such as northern Scandinavia, Iceland, and Greenland. Given the harsh climate and remote nature of these regions, population density is very low. However, there are some inhabited areas, notably parts of northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland. Considering the sparse population in these latitudes and time zone, Santa's visitations would be minimal.",
