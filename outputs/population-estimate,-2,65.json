{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC-02:00 is primarily located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, with some islands and a few research stations on the coast of Antarctica. The latitudes between 60N and 70N are mostly covered by sea ice and tundra in the Arctic region, with very few permanent residents. Given these conditions, it's highly unlikely that there are any households for Santa to visit in this timezone and latitude range.", "major_cities": [], "estimated_number_of_households": 0}
