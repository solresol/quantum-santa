  "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-05:30' is not a valid or recognized timezone. Standard timezones are usually offset from UTC by whole hours or half hours, and there isn't a widely recognized timezone with an offset of 5 hours and 30 minutes from UTC. Additionally, the latitudes between 90S and 80S fall entirely within Antarctica, which has no permanent residents, only temporary scientists and researchers at various stations.",
