{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC-01:00 is observed by some islands in the Atlantic Ocean, including Cape Verde. The latitudes between 20N and 30N fall within the tropical region, but since this timezone is primarily over ocean and includes only a few islands, the population density and number of households are relatively low. However, it's still possible for Santa to visit some households in this region.",
