{"reasoning": "The latitude range 80N to 90N falls within the Arctic Circle, where there are no permanent human settlements or households. The area is largely composed of ice caps, glaciers, and frozen tundra. While there may be some temporary research stations or expeditions in this region, they do not constitute permanent households. Therefore, it is unlikely that Santa would have to visit any households in this latitude range.",
