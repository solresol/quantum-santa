{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC+11:00 includes areas such as parts of Russia, Australia, and the Pacific islands. However, when considering latitudes between 80N and 90N, we are looking at the Arctic region. This area is largely uninhabited due to its extreme climate. The only permanent residents in this range would likely be at research stations, but these are not typical households. Therefore, the number of households Santa would have to visit in this specific timezone and latitude range is estimated to be none.",
