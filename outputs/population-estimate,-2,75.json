    "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-02:00' is primarily located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, but it also covers some areas in the North Atlantic, including parts of Greenland. The latitudes between 70N and 80N are within the Arctic Circle, where the climate is inhospitable for most human habitation. However, there are a few research stations and small settlements in this region.",
