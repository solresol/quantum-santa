{"reasoning": "The latitudes between 80S and 70S are located in Antarctica, which is not inhabited by humans outside of temporary research stations. These research stations do not have permanent households, but rather temporary residents who are scientists and support staff. Therefore, it is unlikely that Santa would have to visit any households in this timezone and latitude range.",
