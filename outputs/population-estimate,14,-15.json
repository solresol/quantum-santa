    "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+14:00 is located in the Pacific Ocean, and the latitudes between 20S and 10S correspond to a region that includes parts of the Pacific Islands. However, most of these islands are uninhabited or have very small populations. The only country with a significant population in this timezone and latitude range is Kiribati, specifically the Line Islands. Nevertheless, even in Kiribati, the number of households is relatively small due to the sparse population.",
