  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC-06:00 corresponds to Central Standard Time (CST) in the Americas. The latitudes between 0S and 10N cover a region near the equator, spanning across parts of Central America and northern South America. Major cities in this region include Panama City, Panama; San José, Costa Rica; and Quito, Ecuador. However, not all households in these cities may celebrate Christmas or believe in Santa Claus, as the prevalence of the Santa tradition can vary significantly by country and culture. For the sake of estimation, let's assume that approximately 50% of households in these major cities might have a tradition that includes believing in Santa, considering the mix of cultures and religious beliefs.",
