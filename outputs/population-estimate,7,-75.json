{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC+07:00 and the latitudes between 80S and 70S correspond to a region in Antarctica. There are no permanent cities or households in this region, only temporary research stations. Since these stations are not permanent residences and are typically inhabited by scientists and researchers from various countries, it is unlikely that there would be households where someone believes in Santa in the classical sense of families with children. Therefore, the estimated number of households that Santa would have to visit is zero.", "major_cities": [], "estimated_number_of_households": 0}
