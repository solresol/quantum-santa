{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC+03:30 is observed in Iran. However, the latitudes between 90S and 80S are in Antarctica, which has no permanent residents or households. Only temporary scientists and researchers at various stations, but they do not constitute 'households' in the traditional sense. Therefore, Santa would not have to visit any households in this timezone and latitude range.",
