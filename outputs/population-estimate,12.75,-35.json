{"reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC+12:45' is used only in New Zealand, specifically in the Chatham Islands. The latitudes between 40S and 30S fall within the southern part of the South Island of New Zealand and some surrounding islands, but not exactly where the majority of the population lives in this timezone. However, considering the specific geography and the fact that most of the landmass in these latitudes is uninhabited or very sparsely populated, we can estimate the number of households based on available data about the Chatham Islands.",
