    "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-08:45' does not exist as a standard time zone. Standard time zones are usually offset from UTC by whole hours or half hours, but not by 45 minutes. Additionally, the latitudes between 10N and 20N cover parts of several countries in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. However, without a valid timezone to narrow down the geographical area, it's challenging to estimate household numbers directly. Given that this timezone is non-standard, for the purpose of estimation, we might consider areas around these latitudes that could potentially observe timezones close to UTC-8 (such as PST - Pacific Standard Time), but since the exact region can't be determined due to the non-standard offset, it's more accurate to conclude there are no households specifically in 'UTC-08:45'.",
