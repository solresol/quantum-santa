{"reasoning": "The latitudes between 80N and 90N fall within the Arctic Circle, where there are no permanent human settlements or households. This region is largely composed of ice sheets, glaciers, and frozen tundra, making it uninhabitable for humans. The timezone UTC+02:00 does not affect the presence of households in this region, as it is still a remote and inhospitable area.",
