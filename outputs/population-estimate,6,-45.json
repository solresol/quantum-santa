    "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+06:00 is primarily located in the Indian Ocean and parts of Antarctica. The latitudes between 50S and 40S fall within the Southern Ocean, which surrounds Antarctica. This region is largely uninhabited by humans, with only a few research stations on the Antarctic coast. Since Santa's visits are typically associated with human populations, it's unlikely he would have households to visit in this area.",
