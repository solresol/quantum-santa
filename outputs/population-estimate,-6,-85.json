  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC-06:00 corresponds to Central Standard Time in North America, but when considering latitudes between 90S and 80S, we are looking at a region in Antarctica. There are no permanent cities or households in this range, only research stations. Given that these are not traditional households and the majority of people residing there temporarily for scientific purposes are adults, it's unlikely anyone believes in Santa in the classical sense as children do. Therefore, the estimated number of households Santa would need to visit is zero.",
