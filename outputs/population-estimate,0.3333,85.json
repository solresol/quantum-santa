  "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC+00:20' does not exist. Standard time zones are usually offset from UTC by whole hours or half hours, and there is no known timezone with a 20-minute offset. Additionally, the latitudes between 80N and 90N are largely composed of Arctic ice and water, with very few permanent human settlements. The North Pole itself is located at approximately 90N, but it does not have any permanent residents, only temporary scientific researchers.",
