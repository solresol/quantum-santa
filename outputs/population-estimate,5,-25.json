    "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+05:00 is primarily located in the Indian Ocean and parts of Asia, but when considering the latitudes between 30S and 20S, we are looking at a region that includes parts of the southern Indian Ocean and possibly some islands or coastal areas. However, this region does not include any significant landmasses with dense populations. The majority of households Santa would visit are typically found in densely populated areas on continents, which are largely absent in this specified geographic and temporal range.",
