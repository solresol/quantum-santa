  "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-02:00' corresponds to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean and a few islands in the South Atlantic. The latitudes between 30N and 40N fall within this timezone, but this region is mostly ocean with no permanent residents. There are some research stations on islands like Tristan da Cunha, but the population is very small and not significant enough to warrant a visit from Santa.",
