    "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+09:00 is observed in parts of Asia, including Japan and South Korea. However, the latitudes between 40S and 30S are located in the Southern Hemisphere, which means they are not within the geographical region that observes this timezone. This area is mostly covered by the Pacific Ocean and some remote islands, with no significant landmasses or populated areas. As a result, there are likely no households for Santa to visit in this region.",
