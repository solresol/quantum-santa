{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC+14:00 is one of the most eastern timezones and includes parts of Kiribati, specifically the Line Islands. However, the latitudes between 80N and 90N are situated in the Arctic region, which does not overlap with the geographical location of the UTC+14:00 timezone. This area is largely covered by sea ice and has no permanent population or households.",
