{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC+04:00 includes parts of the Middle East, the Caucasus region, and western Asia. The latitudes between 30N and 40N in this timezone cover areas such as parts of Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. However, Christmas is not widely celebrated in these countries due to their predominantly Muslim populations. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that Santa would have very few, if any, households to visit in this region.",
