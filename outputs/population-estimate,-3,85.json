  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC-03:00 spans across the Atlantic Ocean and parts of South America, but when considering latitudes between 80N and 90N, we are looking at areas within the Arctic Circle. This region is largely composed of sea ice and tundra, with very few permanent human settlements. The majority of the landmass in this range belongs to Greenland (under Danish jurisdiction) and a small portion of northern Canada, along with some Norwegian islands. However, even in these areas, human habitation is sparse and mostly limited to research stations or small Inuit communities.",
