    "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC+08:45' is not a standard timezone and is actually used by only a few places, specifically some areas in Western Australia. The latitudes between 40N and 50N would put us in the northern hemisphere, but since UTC+08:45 is primarily associated with Western Australia which falls within the southern hemisphere, we're looking at an unusual overlap that does not correspond to any major populated regions in this specific latitude range.",
