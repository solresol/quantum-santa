{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC-10:00 includes the Hawaiian Islands and some uninhabited islands in the Pacific. The latitudes between 30S and 20S are located in the Southern Hemisphere, but the UTC-10:00 timezone is primarily in the Northern Hemisphere. However, there are a few islands in the Pacific that fall within this timezone and latitude range, including parts of French Polynesia. Given the sparse population in these areas, the number of households is likely to be very small.",
