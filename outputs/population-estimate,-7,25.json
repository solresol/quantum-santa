{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC-07:00 corresponds to the Mountain Standard Time (MST) zone in North America. The latitudes between 20N and 30N cover parts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. Major cities in this region include Phoenix, Arizona; Tucson, Arizona; and Hermosillo, Mexico. Considering the Christmas traditions in these countries, it's likely that a significant proportion of households have children who believe in Santa Claus. Assuming an average household size of 2.5 people and using city population data, we can estimate the number of households. Phoenix has a population of around 1.7 million, Tucson has around 550,000, and Hermosillo has approximately 900,000. Using these numbers, we can estimate the total population in the region to be around 3.15 million. With an average household size of 2.5, this gives us roughly 1.26 million households. Assuming that about 30% of these households have children who believe in Santa (a rough estimate considering factors like family size and cultural traditions), we arrive at an estimated number of households that Santa would need to visit.",
