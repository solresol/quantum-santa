    "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-08:30' is not a valid or recognized timezone. Timezones are typically offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by whole hours or 30-minute increments, but 'UTC-08:30' does not correspond to any standard timezone. Additionally, latitudes between 60N and 70N in this non-existent timezone would likely fall within the Arctic Circle, where human habitation is scarce due to extreme climate conditions.",
