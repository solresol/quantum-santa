    "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+05:00 is primarily located in the Indian Ocean and parts of Asia, but when considering latitudes between 80S and 70S, we are looking at a region that covers parts of Antarctica. This area is not inhabited by humans in a traditional sense (i.e., no permanent residents or households as seen in other parts of the world) due to its extreme climate and lack of infrastructure. Scientific research stations do exist in this region, but they do not qualify as 'households' in the conventional understanding of residential dwellings.",
