  "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-12:00' is also known as Baker Island Time. This timezone is used by Baker Island, which is an uninhabited atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The latitudes between 0S and 10N include a portion of the ocean where some islands are located, but most of these islands are uninhabited or have very small populations. Given that there are no major cities or permanent residents in this timezone within the specified latitudes, it's reasonable to conclude that Santa would not have any households to visit.",
