  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+05:00 is primarily located in the Indian Ocean and parts of Asia, but when considering latitudes between 70S and 60S, we are looking at a region that covers parts of Antarctica. Given this geographical constraint, there are no permanent residents or households in this area due to its inhospitable climate and lack of infrastructure for human habitation. The only inhabitants are temporary scientists and researchers at various Antarctic stations.",
