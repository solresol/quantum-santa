  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC-01:30 does not exist. Timezones are typically offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by whole hours or half-hours, and there is no recognized timezone with an offset of -01:30. Additionally, the latitudes between 0S and 10N encompass a significant portion of the Atlantic Ocean and parts of South America and Africa. However, without a valid timezone, it's impossible to accurately estimate the number of households Santa would need to visit.",
