{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC+11:00 and the latitudes between 10N and 20N are located in the Pacific Ocean, covering areas such as the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and parts of Papua New Guinea. Given the sparse population and remote locations within this range, it's reasonable to estimate the number of households Santa would have to visit. However, considering the lack of permanent residents on many of these islands and the limited access due to geographical constraints, the actual number could be significantly low.",
