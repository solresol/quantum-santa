  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+14:00 is one of the most eastern timezones, and it includes parts of Kiribati. However, when considering latitudes between 50S and 40S, we're looking at a region in the southern hemisphere. This area does not overlap with any landmasses that are known to be inhabited by humans within the specified timezone. Kiribati's islands are generally located north of the equator, thus outside our latitude range.",
