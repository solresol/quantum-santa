{"reasoning": "The latitude range 90S to 80S falls entirely within Antarctica, which has no permanent residents or households. The only people present in this region are temporary scientists and researchers at various stations, who do not constitute households in the traditional sense. UTC-10:00 is a timezone that includes Hawaii and some other Pacific islands, but it does not apply to Antarctica, which uses different timezones for each research station. However, even if we consider the timezone, there would still be no households to visit.",
