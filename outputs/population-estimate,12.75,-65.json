{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC+12:45 is used by New Zealand's Chatham Islands. However, the latitudes between 70S and 60S are in Antarctica, which has no permanent residents or households, only temporary scientists and researchers at various stations. Since Santa visits households with permanent residents, there would be no households for him to visit in this timezone within the specified latitudes.",
