{"reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC+08:45' is not a standard timezone and does not correspond to any specific region. However, it's close to the timezone 'UTC+08:00' or 'UTC+09:00', which could indicate a location in East Asia or Australia. The latitudes 'between 10S and 0S' suggest a region near the equator in the Southern Hemisphere. Given these constraints, one possible location is Western Australia. However, upon further research, it appears that 'UTC+08:45' was indeed used in a small region of Western Australia, specifically in the Eucla area, as an unofficial timezone to facilitate trade with South Australia, which is in the 'UTC+09:30' or 'UTC+10:30' timezones during daylight saving. This region has a very sparse population.",
