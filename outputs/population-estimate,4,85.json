{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC+04:00 and the latitudes between 80N and 90N do not overlap with any permanent human settlements. This region is largely covered by the Arctic Ocean and includes parts of the North Pole. The few research stations in this area are not considered households, and there are no major cities. Therefore, Santa would not have to visit any households in this region.",
