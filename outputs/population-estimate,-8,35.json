{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC-08:00 corresponds to the Pacific Time Zone in North America. The latitudes between 30N and 40N in this timezone include parts of the western United States, specifically California, Oregon, Nevada, and Washington. Since Santa Claus is a mythical figure who delivers gifts on Christmas Eve, we can estimate the number of households he would have to visit based on the population density and household numbers in these regions. However, without exact data on household numbers within this specific latitude and timezone range, an accurate estimation is challenging. Nonetheless, considering the vast population and urbanization in cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland, the number of households would be substantial.",
