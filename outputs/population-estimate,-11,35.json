    "reasoning": "The timezone UTC-11:00 is primarily located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, covering areas such as Samoa and the Midway Atoll. The latitudes between 30N and 40N within this timezone would likely include only a few small islands or atolls with minimal population. Given the remote nature of these locations and the lack of significant landmasses, it is reasonable to estimate that there are very few households in this region.",
