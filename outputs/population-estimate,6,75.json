  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+06:00 includes parts of Russia, Kazakhstan, and Bangladesh. However, the latitudes between 70N and 80N are limited to the Arctic regions of Russia and Norway. In this range, there are only a few small cities and research stations. The majority of these locations do not have a significant number of households with children who believe in Santa. Considering the harsh climate and remote nature of these areas, it's likely that only a handful of households might be inhabited by people who celebrate Christmas with a belief in Santa Claus.",
