  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+06:30 corresponds to the Cocos Islands, which are an Australian external territory in the Indian Ocean. The latitudes between 90S and 80S are in Antarctica, where there are no permanent cities or households, only research stations. However, considering the Cocos Islands as the primary location for this timezone, we can estimate the number of households that might believe in Santa. Since the Cocos Islands have a small population of around 600 people, mostly with Australian and Malay heritage, it's possible that some households might celebrate Christmas and believe in Santa.",
