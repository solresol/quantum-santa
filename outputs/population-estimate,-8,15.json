{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC-08:00 corresponds to the Pacific Time Zone, and the latitudes between 10N and 20N fall within the tropics. However, this region is largely oceanic, covering parts of the Pacific Ocean. The only significant landmass in this region is a small portion of Mexico and some islands. Given that Santa's visits are typically associated with inhabited areas, especially during Christmas which is celebrated in winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and considering the sparse population in these latitudes within the UTC-08:00 timezone, it's reasonable to deduce that there would be very few if any households for Santa to visit. Moreover, many of the islands in this region are uninhabited or have very small populations.",
