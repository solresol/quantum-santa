{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC-11:00 is observed by several Pacific island nations, including Samoa and the Line Islands of Kiribati. The latitudes between 0S and 10N encompass a region that includes parts of these islands. However, given the sparse population and limited land area within this specific timezone and latitude range, it's reasonable to estimate the number of households Santa would need to visit. Notably, many of these areas are uninhabited or have very small populations.",
