{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC+08:45 is not a standard timezone and is actually used by only a few locations, including Eucla, Western Australia. The latitudes between 40S and 30S in this region would primarily cover parts of southern Western Australia. Given the sparse population in these areas, the number of households Santa would have to visit could be very low or even zero if we consider only the immediate vicinity of Eucla, which is the primary location using this offset. However, since there are some settlements and farms within this range, it's not entirely accurate to say there are no households at all.",
