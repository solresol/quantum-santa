  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+05:45 is observed in Nepal. However, the latitudes between 20S and 10S are located in the Southern Hemisphere, primarily over the ocean and some parts of Australia, Brazil, and South Africa. Since Nepal is located in the Northern Hemisphere, between 26°N and 31°N latitudes, there are no households in Nepal within the specified timezone (UTC+05:45) that fall between the latitudes 20S and 10S.",
