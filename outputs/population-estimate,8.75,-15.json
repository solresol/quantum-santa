{"reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC+08:45' is not a standard timezone and does not correspond to any major city or region. Additionally, the latitudes 'between 20S and 10S' are in the southern hemisphere, primarily over the ocean. The only landmasses in this region are parts of Australia and some islands. However, none of these areas use the 'UTC+08:45' timezone. Western Australia uses UTC+8, but not UTC+08:45. Therefore, it is likely that there are no households in this specific timezone within the given latitudes.",
