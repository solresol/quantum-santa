{"reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-08:00' refers to the Pacific Time Zone, which includes the western coast of North America. However, the latitudes 'between 80N and 90N' refer to the Arctic region, which is largely uninhabited. This area is mostly covered by sea ice and is not suitable for human habitation. Therefore, it is unlikely that there are any households in this region that Santa would need to visit.",
