  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC-06:00 includes parts of Central America, specifically countries such as Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, and Belize. Within the latitudes between 10N and 20N, there are several cities where Santa traditions might be observed due to cultural influences from North America and Europe. Considering the population density and urbanization in these areas, I estimate that a significant proportion of households, especially those with children, might celebrate Christmas and believe in Santa Claus. However, this proportion can vary greatly depending on local customs, religious beliefs, and socioeconomic factors.",
