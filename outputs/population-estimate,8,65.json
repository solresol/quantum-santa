  "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC+08:00' corresponds to countries such as China, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Taiwan. However, the latitudes 'between 60N and 70N' correspond to the Arctic region, which is largely uninhabited. This region includes parts of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia, but none of these countries have significant populations in the UTC+08:00 timezone at these high latitudes.",
