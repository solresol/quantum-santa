    "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-04:00' corresponds to parts of the Atlantic Ocean and a few islands in the South Atlantic. The latitudes between 30S and 20S fall within this region, but it is mostly ocean with very few inhabited islands or landmasses. Therefore, the number of households that Santa would have to visit in this timezone and latitude range is expected to be negligible.",
