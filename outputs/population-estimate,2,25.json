  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+02:00 includes parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia. However, the latitudes between 20N and 30N are mostly desert or sparsely populated regions in North Africa and the Middle East. While there are some cities and towns in this region, they are relatively small compared to other parts of the world. Additionally, Christmas is not widely celebrated in many Muslim-majority countries in this region, which would reduce the number of households that Santa would need to visit.",
