  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+03:00 spans across parts of Europe, Africa, and Western Asia. However, the latitudes between 80N and 90N are within the Arctic Circle, where the climate is inhospitable to permanent human habitation. This region includes parts of the Arctic Ocean, northern Greenland, and a few remote islands. As a result, there are no permanent households in this region.",
