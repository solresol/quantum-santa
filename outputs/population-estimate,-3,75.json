    "reasoning": "The latitude range 70N to 80N falls within the Arctic Circle, which is largely uninhabited due to its harsh climate. The UTC-03:00 timezone intersects with this region in the western part of Greenland and some islands in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. However, the population density in these areas is extremely low, with only a few small research stations, military bases, and indigenous communities.",
