  "reasoning": "The latitudes between 70N and 80N in the timezone UTC+00:00 fall within the Arctic Circle, which is largely uninhabited due to its harsh climate. This region includes parts of the Arctic Ocean and northernmost tips of countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland, and potentially parts of Russia, Greenland (Denmark), and Canada. Given the extreme conditions, human habitation is extremely sparse, mostly limited to research stations, military outposts, or small indigenous communities. However, these are not typical households as seen in more temperate zones.",
