    "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+04:00 includes parts of the Atlantic Ocean, and some islands in the southern part of this timezone are uninhabited or have no permanent residents. The latitudes between 50S and 40S fall within the Southern Ocean, which surrounds Antarctica. This region is not suitable for human habitation due to extreme climate conditions. Therefore, it's unlikely that there are any households for Santa to visit in this area.",
