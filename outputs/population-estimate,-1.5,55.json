    "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-01:30' does not exist. Timezones are typically offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by whole or half hours, but there is no UTC-01:30 timezone. Additionally, even if we consider the closest possible timezones, such as UTC-02:00 or UTC-01:00, and focus on latitudes between 50N and 60N, these regions would primarily include parts of Canada, possibly some areas in Europe like the UK, Ireland, and northern parts of mainland Europe. However, without a valid timezone to precisely determine the geographical area, we cannot accurately estimate the number of households.",
