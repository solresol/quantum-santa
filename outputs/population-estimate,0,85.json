{"reasoning": "The latitudes between 80N and 90N are within the Arctic Circle, where there are no permanent human settlements or households. This region is mostly composed of ice and water, with some research stations and temporary camps, but no established cities or towns. Therefore, Santa would not have to visit any households in this timezone and latitude range.",
