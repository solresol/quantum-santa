    "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+04:30 corresponds to Afghanistan Time. The latitudes between 60N and 70N are located in the Arctic region, which does not overlap with Afghanistan's geographical location. Afghanistan is generally situated between latitudes 29N and 38N. Given this information, it is unlikely that Santa would have any households to visit in the specified timezone within the given latitudes.",
