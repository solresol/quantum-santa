    "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+10:00 includes parts of Australia, Papua New Guinea, and some Pacific islands. The latitudes between 30N and 40N are in the Northern Hemisphere, while most of the landmass in the UTC+10:00 timezone is in the Southern Hemisphere. However, there is a small portion of Australia that falls within this latitude range. Since Christmas occurs during the summer season in the Southern Hemisphere, Santa's visit would typically occur on December 24/25. Given the sparse population and limited land area within these constraints, we can still estimate based on available data.",
