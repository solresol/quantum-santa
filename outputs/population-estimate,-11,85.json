    "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-11:00' is observed by the Samoa Time Zone, which includes American Samoa and the independent nation of Samoa. However, these locations are not between 80N and 90N latitude. The latitudes between 80N and 90N encompass parts of the Arctic Ocean, including the North Pole, and do not include any permanent human settlements or households. Therefore, Santa would not have to visit any households in this timezone within the specified latitudes.",
