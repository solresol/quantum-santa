    "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+05:45 is observed in Nepal. The latitudes between 40N and 50N fall within the Himalayan region, including parts of Nepal, India, Pakistan, and China. However, most of Nepal's population lives in the lower lying areas, and the region between 40N and 50N in Nepal is mostly mountainous with sparse population. Considering the difficulty of accessing these areas and the low population density, it is likely that there are very few households for Santa to visit.",
