  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC-06:00 covers parts of Canada, Mexico, and the United States. In the latitudes between 50N and 60N, there are several cities with significant populations. However, not all households in these cities may believe in Santa or celebrate Christmas. Assuming a moderate to high proportion of households that do believe in Santa, given the cultural influence of Christmas in these regions, I estimate the number of households Santa would need to visit.",
