    "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+13:00 is primarily located over the Pacific Ocean, and the latitudes between 30N and 40N are mostly covered by water in this region. The few islands that exist in this area have small populations, but most of them are not inhabited or have very limited habitation. Therefore, it's likely that there are no households for Santa to visit in this specific timezone and latitude range.",
