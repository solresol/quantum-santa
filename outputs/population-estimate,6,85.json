  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+06:00 includes parts of Russia, Kazakhstan, and Bangladesh, among other countries. However, the latitudes between 80N and 90N are largely within the Arctic Circle and consist of remote, sparsely populated areas with limited to no permanent human settlements. The region is mostly covered by ice and snow, and there are no major cities or significant population centers in this range. Given the harsh climate and lack of infrastructure, it's unlikely that there are any households where someone might believe in Santa.",
