{"reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-10:00' is observed by Hawaii and some other Pacific islands. However, the latitudes 'between 80N and 90N' refer to the Arctic region, which does not overlap with the UTC-10:00 timezone. The Arctic region within these latitudes is largely uninhabited, with no permanent residents, only temporary scientists and researchers at various stations.",
