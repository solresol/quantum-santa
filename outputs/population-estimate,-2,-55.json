    "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-02:00' corresponds to the Mid-Atlantic Time Zone. The latitudes between 60S and 50S fall within the Southern Ocean, which surrounds Antarctica. This region is not inhabited by humans, except for some research stations on the Antarctic continent itself, but those are not households in the traditional sense. Given that Santa's visits are typically associated with populated areas where children reside, it's reasonable to conclude there would be no households for him to visit within these parameters.",
