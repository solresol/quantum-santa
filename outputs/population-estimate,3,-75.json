  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+03:00 includes parts of Europe, Africa, and Western Asia. However, the latitudes between 80S and 70S are in Antarctica, which has no permanent residents, only temporary scientists and researchers at various stations. Since these stations are not households in the traditional sense and do not have a permanent population, it's reasonable to estimate that Santa would not have any households to visit in this region.",
