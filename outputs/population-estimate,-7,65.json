    "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-07:00' corresponds to the Mountain Time Zone in North America. The latitudes between 60N and 70N fall within the Arctic Circle, which is largely uninhabited due to harsh climate conditions. However, there are some inhabited areas within this range, such as parts of Alaska (USA), Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Manitoba (Canada). Given the sparse population density in these regions, it's likely that Santa would have fewer households to visit compared to more populous areas.",
