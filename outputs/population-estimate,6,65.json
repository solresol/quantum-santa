  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+06:00 and the latitudes between 60N and 70N cover parts of Russia, specifically areas within Siberia. This region includes several cities but is sparsely populated compared to other parts of the world. The belief in Santa Claus (or Ded Moroz in Russian culture) is present, especially among children and in festive traditions. However, the proportion of households where someone might believe in Santa could be lower compared to Western countries due to cultural differences. Considering these factors, I will estimate the number of households based on available city data and adjust for the cultural context.",
