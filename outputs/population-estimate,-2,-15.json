  "reasoning": "The timezone UTC-02:00 and the latitudes between 20S and 10S correspond to a region in the South Atlantic Ocean, which includes several islands. The most notable territory in this region is the Brazilian island of Fernando de Noronha, as well as the South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, which are British overseas territories. Given that these locations have limited population and are not typically associated with traditional Christmas celebrations or residential areas where Santa would visit, it's reasonable to estimate a very low number of households.",
