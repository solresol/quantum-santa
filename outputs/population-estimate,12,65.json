{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC+12:00 includes areas such as Kiribati, Tuvalu, and parts of Russia like the Kuril Islands and Anadyr. However, when narrowing it down to latitudes between 60N and 70N, we are primarily looking at remote and sparsely populated regions of Russia and possibly some uninhabited or very lightly inhabited areas in other countries within this timezone. Given these constraints, it's reasonable to deduce that the number of households Santa would need to visit is minimal to none due to the extreme remoteness, harsh climate, and limited human habitation.",
