  "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC+05:00' includes parts of the Indian Ocean and some areas of Antarctica, but between latitudes 40S and 30S, it primarily covers ocean. There are no major landmasses or permanent human settlements within this range that would fall under the UTC+05:00 timezone. Therefore, Santa would not have any households to visit in this specific geographic and temporal context.",
