    "reasoning": "The timezone UTC+01:00 spans across parts of Western and Central Africa, as well as some European countries. However, the latitudes between 10N and 20N fall largely within the African region. Considering Christmas traditions and the prevalence of Santa Claus folklore, it's primarily observed in Christian communities. Many countries in this timezone and latitude range have significant Muslim or other non-Christian populations. Therefore, the tradition of Santa visiting households might not be widely practiced or recognized.",
