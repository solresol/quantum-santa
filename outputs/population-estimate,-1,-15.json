    "reasoning": "The timezone 'UTC-01:00' corresponds to the Cape Verde Time zone. The latitudes between 20S and 10S fall within the Southern Hemisphere, primarily covering parts of Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, and the southern Atlantic Ocean. However, Cape Verde is located off the coast of West Africa in the Northern Hemisphere, with latitudes ranging from approximately 14.8°N to 17.2°N, which does not overlap with the specified latitude range of 20S to 10S. Therefore, there are no households in the 'UTC-01:00' timezone within these latitudes.",
