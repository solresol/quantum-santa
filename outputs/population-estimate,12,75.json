{"reasoning": "The timezone UTC+12:00 includes areas such as the Kiribati Line Islands, Tuvalu, and parts of Russia like Anadyr. However, when considering latitudes between 70N and 80N within this timezone, we're primarily looking at remote, sparsely populated regions of Russia, particularly in the Chukchi Autonomous Okrug and possibly the Krasnoyarsk Krai if it extends that far east. Given the extreme climate conditions in these areas (Arctic tundra), human habitation is very limited, mostly confined to small indigenous communities or temporary research stations.",
